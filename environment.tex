\section{Lattice grid}\label{sec:lattice_grid}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This is Flatland's given representation
\end{itemize}


\section{Ordinary directed graph}\label{sec:directed_graph}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This is not sufficient
\end{itemize}

\section{Extended directed graph}\label{sec:directed_graph}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider the set of traversal directions $D = \{north, south, east, west\}$  and a list of $m$ cells $C$
	\item The Flatland environment is defined as a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V = C \times D$ and $E \subseteq V \times V$, and a list of $n$ agents $A$
	\item Each agent $a \in A$ is associated with a start vertex $s_a \in V$ and a set of target vertices $T^a \subset V$
	\item Time is considered discrete; between two consecutive timesteps, an agent can either move to another vertex or stay at its current vertex. 
	\item Additionally, each agent $a$ is assigned a departure time $\delta_a$ and an arrival time $\alpha_a$; it is between only these time steps that the agent is permitted to execute move actions
	\item A solution path $\pi_a$ is a finite sequence $(v_j)_{j=1}^k$ of vertices $v_j \in V$ for $0 \leq j \leq k$ such that $(v_j,v_{j+1}) \in E$ for all $0 \leq j < k$, as well as that $v_1 = s_a$ and $v_k \in T^a$
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypergraph}\label{sec:hypergraph}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Flatland environment is defined as an undirected hypergraph $G = (X,E)$
\end{itemize}
